      <description>Who I Am, Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m also an Electrical Engineer that tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. Now I&amp;rsquo;m just grateful, focused on improving my skills and willing to help others with my experience. I love teaching and I&amp;rsquo;ve already worked as one for a few years.
I&amp;rsquo;m a routine addicted. Waking up early, eating healthy, coding, going to gym, sleeping early and well, that&amp;rsquo;s my definition of a perfect day.</description>
