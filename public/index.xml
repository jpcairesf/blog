      <description>I wrote my first lines of code when I was 11 writing scripts for RPG Maker in Ruby.
At that age I was also using VPN to play MMOs that were unavailable in my country.
No matter how complex the problem was I debug and try to fix it until I solve it or prove that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible. A resilient kid that never let technology take control.
Who I Am, Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer.</description>
