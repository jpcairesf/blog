I wrote my first lines of code when I was 12, writing scripts for RPG Maker in Ruby. I was an average gaming nerd kid with very low hardware specs and internet connection who have spent several days fixing problems, installing programs and configuring to make things work. Computer was my second home and no matter how complex the problem there, I debug and try to fix it until I solve it or prove it impossible.

### My Background

I'm a Software Engineer. I'm also an Electrical Engineer who tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. Now I'm focused on improving my skills and willing to help others with my experience. I love teaching and worked as one for a few years.

### My Habits

I'm a routine addicted. Waking up early, eating healthy, coding, going to the gym, sleeping early and well, that's my definition of a perfect day. Doing these simple things almost everyday makes me extremally happy. My lifestyle also meets technology to achieve high productivity. My Linux setup and CLI tools make my workspace fully configurable and ergonomic to reach the maximum effectiveness.

### My Decisions

Dopamine and substances don't control my actions. This is why I avoid many social medias, drinking, powergaming, tasty food rewarding and laziness. My free time is currently based around coding and studying technology, and I've never have been happier, more productive and healthier both pyshically and mentally.
