I wrote my first lines of code when I was 12, writing scripts for RPG Maker in Ruby. I was an average gaming nerd kid with very low hardware specs and internet connection who have spent several days fixing problems, installing programs and configuring to make things work. Computer was my second home and no matter how complex the problem there, I debug and try to fix it until I solve it or prove it impossible.

I'm an Electrical Engineer who tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. 3 of these years I worked with digital marketing, where I had strong contact with data, MySQL and business strategy. These days I was already turning my path to technology, until I finally move to software development. 

I've been working with software since 2021. My focus is backend and my expertises are Java, Spring, Python, Linux and DevOps. I'm also a certified AWS Solutions Architect and Cloud Practitioner since 2023 (yes, with only 2yrs as a dev). I'm currently 100% focused on my career, check out [my Github](https://github.com/jpcairesf) to know more about my projects.

By the way, I love teaching and worked as one for a few years. I enjoy talking about (and teaching) career and programming in general. Feel free to reach me out in some social media :).
