### Prelude
I wrote my first lines of code when I was 11, writing scripts for RPG Maker in Ruby. At that age I was already doing tricky things on the computer like setting up different emulators and using a VPN to play MMOs that weren't available in my country. No matter how complex the problem, I debug and try to fix it until I solve it or prove it impossible.

### My Background
I'm a Software Engineer. I'm also an Electrical Engineer who tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. Now I'm just grateful, focused on improving my skills and willing to help others with my experience. I love teaching and worked as one for a few years. Now I spend time sharing my knowledge across different medias.

### My Habits
I'm a routine addicted. Waking up early, eating healthy, coding, going to the gym, sleeping early and well, that's my definition of a perfect day. Doing these simple things almost everyday makes me extremally happy. My lifestyle also meets technology to achieve high productivity. My Linux setup and CLI tools make my workspace fully configurable and ergonomic to reach the maximum effectiveness.

### My Decisions
Dopamine and substances don't control my actions. This is why I quit many social medias, drinking, powergaming, tasty food rewarding and laziness. My free time is currently based around coding and studying technology, and I've never have been happier, more productive and healthier both pyshically and mentally.
