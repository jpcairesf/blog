I wrote my first lines of code when I was 12, writing scripts for RPG Maker in Ruby. I was an average gaming nerd kid with very low hardware specs and internet connection who have spent several days fixing problems, installing programs and configuring to make things work. Computer was my second home and no matter how complex the problem there, I debug and try to fix it until I solve it or prove it impossible.

### My Background

I'm a Software Engineer. I'm also an Electrical Engineer who tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. Now I'm focused on improving my skills and willing to help others with my experience. I love teaching and worked as one for a few years.

### My Habits

I'm a routine addicted. Waking up early, eating healthy, coding, going to the gym, sleeping early and well, that's my definition of a perfect day. Doing these simple things almost everyday makes me extremally happy. My lifestyle also meets technology to achieve high productivity, you can take a look in my workspace configs in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jpcairesf/dotfiles).

### What I Am Doing

Studying, coding. I charged my motivation to study something that I really love from 2016 to 2022. Now I'm using almost all my free time to learn about computer science fundamentals and technologies. I also love talking about these topics and career, feel free to reach me out in some social media :).
