Dev work environment and productity is currently on hype. NeoVim, tmux, Obsidian, one day you will find a video talking about these tools and then this topic will always be in your feeds. I've tried many of them and here I share my feeback.

> **_TL;DR_** There's no perfect tool, but the ones that fits best for you. Try them yourself and build your best setup, a good environment is a game changer.

### I missed my old environment
My first job as a developer was in a Linux environment. All the commands, shortcuts and configurations I was familiar with were lost when I moved to a Windows-based job. My personal notebook was also Windows, but I just used to college stuff (electrical engineering) and my programming world was on my work notebook. I felt my motivation going low because the things were harder, the lack of some customizations I had was annoying me and I couldn't move to Linux right now. AWS certification exams doesn't support Linux, so I was stucked on Windows for a few months. Yes, I could just keep using Windows with WSL2 but it would still looks like a "let's play an online game" notebook instead of a "let's write some code" one.

### I found the dev productivity appeal
I found the terminal addicted guys while I was stucked on Windows, saved a lot of videos to watch later and when I was free again I just watched everything and tried everything that looks cool or useful. But the reality is different from the videos. There are a lot of new shortcuts to learn, problems that appears when you are working on an enterprise project and functionalities that you realize it's not a pain and it's not worth learning something new if the current is enough. And by the way, most of them aren't really necessary. It looks like if you don't have 100% of your workflow on the terminal you are the worst dev in the world, but the truth is that [we spend most of our work time doing other things that are not writing code](https://www.software.com/reports/code-time-report#:~:text=last%2030%20days.-,Few%20developers%20code%20more%20than%202%20hours%20per%20day,1%20hour%20per%20day%20coding.).

### The ultimate coding motivation hack
When you have a wonderful study room and all the necessary materials, it makes studying a lot easier. It happens for many other topics, and it's not different with coding. The environment modules our behavior, feelings and can boost or drop our motivation. Here I'm talking about softwares, but also hardware, peripherals, every sphere of your whole environment makes the difference. If you have a group of friends studying programming, or if you are part of a community from this niche, it will also helps in the same way. The message is: use all this content for your development, a good environment will make the difference.
