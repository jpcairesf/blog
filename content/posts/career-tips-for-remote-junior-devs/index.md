I started my tech career working from home and yes, there are many barriers to your learning in the beginning if you are not prepared. I already worked from home before this and I applied my "best practices" to make my growth faster.

> **_TL;DR:_** Speak, ask for help and guidance, watch other devs coding and never miss technical discussions.

### Ask For Help, Seriously

**Don't wait an entire day to ask for help** when you are stucked in a task. Also don't give up to early, trying to solve problems by yourself is part of the learning process. As soon as you can, align with your leadership or other devs that are helping you how much time you should spend in a task without any progress. I used to set half of my office hour as a limit before asking for help.

### Practice Your Communication

Communication is the key to make remote work more efficient and it's not a very valued skill by devs. You work in a project that has a business context, products, users and their needs. You probably won't know well all these things and the tasks you will work on probably won't have enough description (trust me). And recognizing this is the beginning of problem solving, even before coding skills.

Here is where communication comes to solve this gap of knowledge about what problem you have to solve. You will need to talk with your teammates to understand very well the requirements associated to the product context. It will guide you to build your solution and your code. **The more you know about the business and the product, the better, faster and easier your code solution will be**.

### Learn In Code Reviews

You will probably have to review pull/merge requests during your work. Read them carefully. **It's a great time to learn new patterns and best practices**. Don't be afraid to ask to the committer how some part of that code works or why was made that way (make sure to ask without sounding rude). This is a kind of curiosity that will make you learn faster, also do it for other decisions in the project.

### Ask To Watch Other Devs Coding/Debugging

And if they could please speak out loud their logic and thoughts. **Understand the workflow and how more experienced devs solve problems**. But I really think that watching teammates debugging is extremely important for entry levels. First to learn debugging shortcuts, workflow also and the project structure. Second to recognize where to start investigating when you find a problem, how to sum up the clues you have or found, and to get experienced.

### Look For Mentorship If You Don't Have

It doesn't need to be something very structured if your teammates don't have much free time or patience. Just ask for 2 or 3 topics that are important for you to learn at that time and context. Ask whoever is helping you the most or your technical leadership. **They have enough experience and context about your knowledge to know what you should learn**.
