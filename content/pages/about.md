# Who I Am, Currently
I'm a Software Engineer. I'm also an Electrical Engineer that tried different careers over 6 years before finding the one I am passionate about. Now I'm just grateful, focused on improving my skills and willing to help others with my experience. I love teaching and I've already worked as one for a few years.

I'm a routine addicted. Waking up early, eating healthy, coding, going to gym, sleeping early and well, that's my definition of a perfect day. And I embrace this simple things, I'm extremally happy doing them almost everyday.

My high productivity meets my lifestyle smoothly. And I also combine technology to achieve it. Arch Linux, Neovim and other CLI tools in general makes my workspace fully configurable to reach the maximum effectiveness. 

# How I Came Up Here
I started college and my work as a teacher at weekends in 2016. Until 2018 I was discovering how it was working with electrical engineering, and realized that my softskills needed improvement urgently. In 2019 I started working with digital marketing and after a year I realized that I didn't want to have a career in this area. I kept in marketing because my improvement was huge, but in the end of 2020 I tried to migrate to data science in my current company. The marketing team was fully made by engineers and we used as much technology and code as possible for automations and data handling. Internal career migration failed but in 2021 I started working with software in another company.

# Earlier Context
In 2023 I realized that I wrote my first lines of code when I was 11. Scripts for RPG Maker written in Ruby. At that age I was using VPN to play MMOs that only have Oceania servers. Yes, I was kind of familiar with puters and stuff.
